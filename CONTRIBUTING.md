# TODO LIST
### (Things to get done before publishing) (in order of difficulty)
    * Finish support for multiple certificates in one video
    * Pack signature file into container file (mp4)
    * Trial metablock-granularity implementation instead of frame-granularity implementation
    * Fork VLC to support display of current certificate
    * PoC hardware implementation that records signatures at time of recording (TPM-backed key)
